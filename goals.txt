Design Goals:

Build remote-controlled, quadcopter

Requirements:
	Remote Control Range of >= 200 m
		Bidirectional radio for telemetry
	Capable of at least 50 ft altitude
	Stable Hover
		prioritize stability over speed
	Bidirectional Serial Interface with connector to add remote control modules
		Should use UART or SPI as Master
	Flight time on battery >= 2 mins
		Track battery life (voltage and total charge dissipated)
	Radio Controller Capable of displaying small amounts of telemetry
		Be able to display battery percentage, voltage, altitude
		
		
		
		

Sensors Needed
	IMU (9dof) for orientation
		Bosch and Invensense
	Altimeter
		
	Shunt or Hall Effect to detect current from battery
		Hall effect sensor will be difficult on PCB
		Shunt wastes Energy
			Can use very small shunt resistance with high resolution ADC?
			Low pass filter of integrate?
	
Wireless
	Wireless connection > 200 m
		Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range
		
Processor
	Use ARM M4F
		Plenty sufficient for modified complimentary filter
	TI has good options
		TM4C123
		MSP432
	ST has higher clock speed options
		STM32F407
