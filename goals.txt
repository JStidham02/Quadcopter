Design Goals:

Build remote-controlled, quadcopter

Requirements:
	Remote Control Range of >= 200 m
		Bidirectional radio for telemetry
	Capable of at least 50 ft altitude
	Stable Hover
		prioritize stability over speed
	Bidirectional Serial Interface with connector to add remote control modules
		Should use UART or SPI as Master (Or do I2C Scan at startup)
	Flight time on battery >= 2 mins
		Track battery life (by voltage or charge dissipated)
	Radio Controller Capable of displaying small amounts of telemetry
		Be able to display battery percentage, voltage, altitude
		
		
		
		

Sensors Needed
	IMU (9dof) for orientation
		Use ICM-20948
		
	Altimeter
		Use Invensense Barometric Pressure Sensor
		
	Temperature
		Use Maxim I2C temperature sensor
	
Wireless
	Wireless connection > 200 m
		Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range
		
		
Processor
	Use ARM M4F
		Plenty sufficient for modified complimentary filter
